# PythonforDataVisualizationMatplotlibAndSeaborn
In this hands-on project, I use the fundamentals of data visualization with Python and leverage the power of two important python libraries known as Matplotlib and seaborn.
to generate line plots, scatterplots, histograms, distribution plot, 3D plots, pie charts, pair plots, and countplots. In this hands-on project, we will complete the following tasks:

Task #1: Plot basic Line Plots

Task #2: Plot Scatterplot

Task #3: Plot pie charts

Task #4: Plot Histograms

Task #5: Plot Multiple Plots

Task #6: Plot Subplots

Task #7: Plot 3D Plots

Task #8: Plot Scatterplot & Count plot (Seaborn)

Task #9: Plot Pairplot, Distplot, and Heatmaps (Seaborn)

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
